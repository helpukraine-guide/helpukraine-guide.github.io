The main ways that you can help are by contacting the politician(s) that represent you, donating to charities that aim to help Ukraine, and educating yourself and others to help combat the spread of Russian propaganda and misinformation.

    - [How to contact a Representative](#how-to-contact-a-representative)
- [What is the best way to contact my representatives?](#what-is-the-best-way-to-contact-my-representatives)
- [What should I say to my representatives?](#what-should-i-say-to-my-representatives)
  - [What should I say when I call my representative?](#what-should-i-say-when-i-call-my-representative)
  - [What should I write in the letter/email to my representative?](#what-should-i-write-in-the-letteremail-to-my-representative)


## How do I find out who my representatives are?

In general you can find your representative(s) contact information by searching on Google for things like: "[your area] MP representative"

For citizens of [EU member states](#i-am-a-citizen-of-a-eu-member-state) and/or the [United States](i-am-a-citizen-of-the-united-states), see below.

### I am a citizen of a EU member state

As a citizen of the EU you can contact both your representatives in your national government and those representing you in the European Parliament (MEPs).

#### How to contact MEPs

To find your MEPs search for your country on this page:
{{</ markdown >}}
{{< create-link >}}https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home{{</ create-link >}}

{{< markdown >}}
After clicking on an MEP, you can find their contact information at the bottom of the page.

### I am a citizen of the United States

As a citizen of the United States you should contact both your [Senators](#how-to-contact-a-senator) and [Representatives](#how-to-contact-a-representative).

#### How to contact a Senator

To contact a Senator select your state on this page: 
{{</ markdown >}}
{{< create-link >}}https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm{{</ create-link >}}

{{< markdown >}}
It should then display your senators with their contact information.

#### How to contact a Representative

A list of your representatives can be found here:
{{</ markdown >}}
{{< create-link >}}https://www.house.gov/representatives{{</ create-link >}}

{{< markdown >}}

Simply scroll to where your state is and you should see the contact information for all your representatives.

## What is the best way to contact my representatives?

**Calling** tends to be the most **effective** and **fastest** way to persuade your representatives.
Written letters also work really well.
If you are not comfortable with either, then sending an email is also helpful.

**We recommend you to call your representative(s).**

---

## What should I say to my representatives?

The main things you should mention when contacting your representative(s) are:

- You want to **increase sanctions** against Russia and its governing officials. In particular, you want Russia to be removed from the SWIFT banking system.
- You want your country to immediately start to provide **humanitarian aid** to those fleeing and still present in Ukraine.
- If you are a **citizen** of a **NATO** member state, you want to create a **'no-fly' zone over Ukraine** and to provide other military aid such as weapons.

### What should I say when I call my representative?

When you call you will most likely speak with a staffer working for your representative.

The following is an example of what you can say:
{{</ markdown >}}

{{< template-script >}}
{{< markdown >}}

Staffer: Hello, **[official’s name]** office. Tom speaking. How can I help you today?

You: I am calling you as one of your constituents to demand immediate action in support of Ukraine. Can I speak with **[official’s name]**?

Staffer: I’m sorry they’re unavailable at the moment. Can I take a message?

You: Yes please. Would you tell **[official’s name]** that I am devastated by the situation in Ukraine and I am disappointed in our Country’s limited response. I demand immediate action to support Ukraine.

I would like to ask **[official’s name]** for their position on this matter, and also implore them to use their mandate to push for stricter sanctions on Russia.

In my mind, the highest priority is to remove Russia from SWIFT.

Following this, I think we need to extend direct humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine. 

This should include an official policy on accepting war refugees (where Slovakia has already acted in making the immigration process easier) but also in sending financial aid, medicinal supplies, and organising transports.

**[If you are a citizen of a NATO member state: I want us and NATO to create a 'No-Fly' zone over Ukraine.]**

**[Feel free to include your own ideas, such as asking for other forms of military aid.]**

I ask that you commit to act in some way. 

Could you please follow up with me?

### What should I write in the letter/email to my representative?

What should be avoided is copy pasting the template email.
Paraphrase and say things in **your own words**. 

If too many identical messages are received, they may be treated as spam.

Here is the what we suggest you start with: 

**Note:** Do not forget to replace the text in **[square brackets]** with relevant information.
{{</ markdown >}}

{{< template-script >}}
{{< markdown >}}

Dear **[official’s name]**,

I am one of your constituents from **[administrative division]**, where I **[short background information about yourself]**.

I am shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and disappointed by our Country’s limited response.

I would like to ask you for your position on this matter, and also implore you to use your mandate to push for stricter sanctions on Russia. In my mind, the highest priority is to remove Russia from SWIFT. Following this, I think we need to extend direct humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine. This should include an official policy on accepting war refugees (where Slovakia has already acted in making the immigration process easier) but also in sending financial aid, medicinal supplies and organizing transports.

**[If you are a citizen of a NATO member state: I want us and NATO to create a 'No-Fly' zone over Ukraine.]**

**[Feel free to include your own ideas, such as asking for other forms of military aid.]**

As part of your constituency, I would very much appreciate a written response, but more importantly a public clarification of your position and intentions.

Best regards,

**[Your name]**
