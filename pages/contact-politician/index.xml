Written letters also work really well. If you are not comfortable with either, then sending an email is also helpful. We recommend you to call your representative(s).
The main things you should mention when contacting your representative(s) are:
You want to increase sanctions against Russia and its governing officials. In particular, you want Russia to be removed from the SWIFT banking system.</description></item><item><title>How to contact your national government representatives</title><link>https://helpukraine.guide/pages/contact-politician/contact-politician-other/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://helpukraine.guide/pages/contact-politician/contact-politician-other/</guid><description>Find your representative(s) contact information by searching on Google for things like: &amp;ldquo;[your area] MP representative&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>What should I say when I call my representative?</title><link>https://helpukraine.guide/pages/contact-politician/phone-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://helpukraine.guide/pages/contact-politician/phone-script/</guid><description>When you call you will most likely speak with a staffer working for your representative.
