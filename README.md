This is the readme page for the site [helpukraine.guide](helpukraine.guide). We appreciate any help with improving the site (see below)

We very quickly threw together the page building on the Hugo-Hero theme by [Zerostatic Themes](https://www.zerostatic.io/theme/hugo-hero/). If you have done your thing to help the citizens of Ukraine deal with the russion invasion, you should buy them a coffee <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zerostatic" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;" ></a>

# How  to help

1. **Improving the website structure and design.** None of us are professional webdesigners, so we very quickly hacked together a static page with Hugo. Any pull requests or suggestions for reworking are appreciated.
2. **Add more resources**. We have collected a bunch of charities coordinating aid and other sites already, but can always use more. PRs welcome!
