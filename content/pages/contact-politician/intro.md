Calling tends to be more effective than sending emails.
Written letters also work better than email.
We recommend you to call your representative(s).


The main things you should mention when contacting your representative(s) are:

- You want to increase sanctions against Russia and its governing officials. In particular, you want Russia to be removed from the SWIFT banking system.
- You want your country to immediately start to provide humanitarian aid to those fleeing and still present in Ukraine.
