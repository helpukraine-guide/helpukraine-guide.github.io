<p>What should be avoided is copy pasting the template email.
Paraphrase and say things in your own words.
If too many identical messages are received, they may be treated as spam.</p><p>Here is the what we suggest you start with:
Note: Do not forget to replace the text in square brackets with the relevant information.</p><p>// make the letter be in a box/darker background looking thing</p><p>Dear <strong>[official’s name]</strong>,</p><p>I am one of your constituents from <strong>[administrative division]</strong>, where I <strong>[short background information about yourself]</strong>.</p><p>I am shocked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and disappointed by our Country’s limited response.</p><p>I would like to ask you for your position on this matter, and also implore you to use your mandate to push for stricter sanctions on Russia. In my mind, the highest priority is to remove Russia from SWIFT. Following this, I think we need to extend direct humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine. This should include an official policy on accepting war refugees (where Slovakia has already acted in making the immigration process easier) but also in sending financial aid, medicinal supplies and organizing transports.</p><p><strong>[If you have any other ideas, feel free to include them.]</strong></p><p>As part of your constituency, I would very much appreciate a written response, but more importantly a public clarification of your position and intentions.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p><strong>[Your name]</strong></p></div><div class=sub-footer>
