Calling tends to be the most effective and fastest way to persuade your representatives.
Written letters also work really well.
If you are not comfortable with either, then sending an email is also helpful.
We recommend you to call your representative(s).


The main things you should mention when contacting your representative(s) are:

- You want to increase sanctions against Russia and its governing officials. In particular, you want Russia to be removed from the SWIFT banking system.
- You want your country to immediately start to provide humanitarian aid to those fleeing and still present in Ukraine.
