When you call you will most likely speak with a staffer working for your representative.

The following is an example of what you can say:

// same as for the sample letter, make the background of the script slightly darker

Staffer: Hello, **[official’s name]** office. Tom speaking. How can I help you today?

You: I am calling you as one of your constituents to demand immediate action in support of Ukraine. Can I speak with **[official’s name]**?

Staffer: I’m sorry they’re unavailable at the moment. Can I take a message?

You: Yes please. Would you tell **[official’s name]** that I am devastated by the situation in Ukraine and I am disappointed in our Country’s limited response. I demand immediate action to support Ukraine.

I would like to ask **[official’s name]** for their position on this matter, and also implore them to use their mandate to push for stricter sanctions on Russia.
In my mind, the highest priority is to remove Russia from SWIFT.

Following this, I think we need to extend direct humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine. This should include an official policy on accepting war refugees (where Slovakia has already acted in making the immigration process easier) but also in sending financial aid, medicinal supplies, and organising transports.

**[Feel free to include your own ideas, such as asking for military aid]**

I ask that you commit to act in some way.
Could you please follow up with me.
