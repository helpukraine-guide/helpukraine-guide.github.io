Written letters also work really well.
If you are not comfortable with either, then sending an email is also helpful.
We recommend you to call your representative(s).</p><p>The main things you should mention when contacting your representative(s) are:</p><ul>
<li>You want to increase sanctions against Russia and its governing officials. In particular, you want Russia to be removed from the SWIFT banking system.</li><li>You want your country to immediately start to provide humanitarian aid to those fleeing and still present in Ukraine.</li></ul><p>To see a sample script of what you can say: <div class=hbutton-container><a class="button button-blue mx-3 hbutton" href=/contact-politician-call>Sample Phone Script</a></div></p><p>To see a template for a letter or email: <div class=hbutton-container><a class="button button-blue mx-3 hbutton" href=/contact-politician-text>Sample Written Letter</a></div></p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2"><p>Find your representative(s) contact information by searching on Google for things like: &ldquo;[your area] MP representative&rdquo;</p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2"><p>When you call you will most likely speak with a staffer working for your representative.</p><p>The following is an example of what you can say:</p><p>// same as for the sample letter, make the background of the script slightly darker</p><p>Staffer: Hello, <strong>[official’s name]</strong> office.

Would you tell <strong>[official’s name]</strong> that I am devastated by the situation in Ukraine and I am disappointed in our Country’s limited response. I demand immediate action to support Ukraine.</p><p>I would like to ask <strong>[official’s name]</strong> for their position on this matter, and also implore them to use their mandate to push for stricter sanctions on Russia.
In my mind, the highest priority is to remove Russia from SWIFT.</p><p>Following this, I think we need to extend direct humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine.

Could you please follow up with me.</p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2"><p>What should be avoided is copy pasting the template email.
Paraphrase and say things in your own words.
